        <p>A wild computer programmer appears!</p>

        <h4>10/18/22</h4>
        <p>Tonight was our last Professional Squad, and it was quite bittersweet. We had a lot of time to share some of our thoughts and reflections on the past 27 weeks that we've been at this. Some
            of us still feel discouraged about everything, like they don't know enough or understand enough. Resoundingly however it sounded like no one here is going to be sitting idly. This cohort is
            stocked full of many dedicated learners. For a lot of us, Merit America completely reignited our love of learning. It was certainly the push I needed to actually dedicate myself to learning
            how to code. And now there's definitely no stopping me because there's so much I want to know. There's also so much I have to relearn. I haven't worked on anything in Java for over 7 weeks
            and I'm worried about forgetting everything I learned in Module 1 and 2, which was all of the Java and Backend programming. I want to build an API, several actually. Many of my fellow 
            learners are hoping to get right into the field (myself included). But even if I don't wind up with a job right away I already have my sights set on my next objectives. I've said it many
            times since we rounded the third module, and it's that I'll be ecstatic to just have the time back. Being regularly available to my life outside of code again will be a great gift to me.<br />
            React week 3 is intense. Going over state, router, props again, arrays, forms, etc. Scrimba crammed a lot into this weeks lessons. Basically double the video length alone from the previous
            two. It's going alright, and I feel as though I'm grasping it. I managed to write at least an entire static webpage with React so I'm sure I'll grasp all of this with practice.<br />
        </p>

        <h4>10/16/22</h4>
        <p>Done with React week 2! We learned Props, and parsing data into our components with props. I'm starting to see how I could easily redesign this site with React, just need the time to put
            it together. It's going to be an intensely busy week for me this coming week. The courseload is double this week what it has been the previous two, as well as a Pair Programming
            assignment. But there's only 5 more weeks left until this is all done. I can see the light at the end of the tunnel, and I have been for a moment, but knowing that it's coming isn't
            making it any easier for me to focus.
        </p>
        
        <h4>10/10/22</h4>
        <p>React Week 1 is finished! Feels good. My first solo project wasn't very "Reactive," but it uses JSX and the ReactDOM to render a small "business card" webpage for me. It's pretty funny
            to me that learning, and working with the React syntax was easier than putting the CSS part of the page together.<br />
            <br />Feel free to take a look at my business card <a href="https://gregarious-gecko-5d1f8a.netlify.app/" target="_BLANK">Here!</a><br />
            <br />Onward to more React this week, as well a paired programming assignment. I do enjoy getting to work with other learners on these small projects. But also, I just want to not be
            so damn busy with all of this course work. There's literally no rest for the weary in this course. Only 6 weeks left. Hope you're all having a good day.
        </p>

        <h4>10/6/22</h4>
        <p>
            So far the Scrimba course on React is pretty good. It's a very neat setup where you learn alongside an instructor. The lessons are video based, but happens in an editor environment.
            At any time you can pause the video, edit the code yourself to play around with it, and Scrimba notes the point in the video for you where changes were made. When you resume the video
            the code picks up where the instructor left off, but saves your edits in a timeline. What incredible technology. I may have to play with more Scrimba courses in the future. However in
            trying to follow along in my local environment (VSCode rather than just coding in the Scrimba editor), some things are getting lost in translation. Components won't render, imports
            don't seem to be working for me. I'll have to ask about this during squads this week. In the meantime I'm grasping the syntax and how it all works just fine. But it would be nice to 
            see the results working in real time for me just like it's working in the instruction vids. Head down, keep swinging.
        </p>

        <h4>10/3/22</h4>
        <p>I'm so exhausted. I haven't had the energy to do anything other than my required course work. I've had a chance to try out Bootstrap, but I think I like Grid and Flexbox better overall.
            I'm starting the React course on Scrimba this week. After we finish this we're supposed to be done with all of the required course material here. Maybe, just maybe, I can get through
            the Scrimba course quick enough to finally find time to build more of my own projects before graduation. My list of things to do is growing faster than I can work on it. My plan for
            this webpage is to use this as a Developer Blog for now. Once I have a proper website designed, I'll have a link for the blog off the landing page. I plan to start actually rebuilding
            this site soon, and when I do I'll leave a link to the project here. For now it's all a bunch of course work for me. Hope you have a good day.          
        </p>

        <h4>9/26/22</h4>
        <p>My Github repository is pretty well documented now. No new work on my website as of yet. I needed a weekend off, and so I took one. My ToDo app 
            needs some bug fixing and refactoring to make the code less spaghetti'd. But I'll get to that later. For now the app basically works. I'm going
            to start a new API project or two to get familiar with that again. We've spent the past 4 weeks on Front End development, and I don't want to get
            rusty on Java. I can't have that at all. Back end or bust for me my friends. Hope you all have a good day.
        </p>
        
        <h4>9/23/22</h4>
        <p>So I scrapped my original design. In frustration I re-wireframed a layout that would probably look better for mobile in the first place.
            I'm coming into the weekend and hoping to really spend some time getting it polished and presentable. In the future I'm planning to
            transform this page into my Dev-Blog. For now it'll serve as the front face while I work on the rest of this website behind the scenes.
            Once I get an MVP going I'll post a link to it on here so anyone who wants can navigate around and check it out. And then I have a long
            list of personal projects I want to start tackling. There's just never enough hours in the day. I did however get my actual Github cleaned
            up and looking good. That can be found <a href="https://github.com/kbooms">here</a>. That's all I have for now :) <br />
            Wherever you are, whatever you're doing, I hope you're having a good day!
        </p>
        
        <h4>9/20/22</h4>
        <p>I just screwed the whole thing up. And at this point I have no idea where I went wrong, but I might have messed up a git merge. None of
            my CSS looks right, and I might have to start over. God damnit.</p>

        <h4>9/15/22</h4>
        <p>I closed up shop for the night. Got my grid fixed, messed up what I tried to start as the dev-log. Oh well. Live and learn I guess.
        Had hoped to do a bit more on it tonight, but I forgot my laptop charger at home, and I have jobs to apply to first. Wish me luck.</p>
