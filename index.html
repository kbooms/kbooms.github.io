        <p>A wild computer programmer appears!</p>

        <h4>9/26/22</h4>
        <p>My Github repository is pretty well documented now. No new work on my website as of yet. I needed a weekend off, and so I took one. My ToDo app 
            needs some bug fixing and refactoring to make the code less spaghetti'd. But I'll get to that later. For now the app basically works. I'm going
            to start a new API project or two to get familiar with that again. We've spent the past 4 weeks on Front End development, and I don't want to get
            rusty on Java. I can't have that at all. Back end or bust for me my friends. Hope you all have a good day.
        </p>
        
        <h4>9/23/22</h4>
        <p>So I scrapped my original design. In frustration I re-wireframed a layout that would probably look better for mobile in the first place.
            I'm coming into the weekend and hoping to really spend some time getting it polished and presentable. In the future I'm planning to
            transform this page into my Dev-Blog. For now it'll serve as the front face while I work on the rest of this website behind the scenes.
            Once I get an MVP going I'll post a link to it on here so anyone who wants can navigate around and check it out. And then I have a long
            list of personal projects I want to start tackling. There's just never enough hours in the day. I did however get my actual Github cleaned
            up and looking good. That can be found <a href="https://github.com/kbooms">here</a>. That's all I have for now :) <br />
            Wherever you are, whatever you're doing, I hope you're having a good day!
        </p>
        
        <h4>9/20/22</h4>
        <p>I just screwed the whole thing up. And at this point I have no idea where I went wrong, but I might have messed up a git merge. None of
            my CSS looks right, and I might have to start over. God damnit.</p>

        <h4>9/15/22</h4>
        <p>I closed up shop for the night. Got my grid fixed, messed up what I tried to start as the dev-log. Oh well. Live and learn I guess.
        Had hoped to do a bit more on it tonight, but I forgot my laptop charger at home, and I have jobs to apply to first. Wish me luck.</p>
