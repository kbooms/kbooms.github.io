            <h3>10/25/22</h3>
            <p>
                Doing a layout update. A lot of my previous writing was cut and archived for now. When I figure out how to set up an actual blog app, I'll add it back somehow for anyone interested in 
                the nonsensical ravings of a lunatic mind. This things been up for over a month, and I haven't really had any time to actually get it as flashy as I had hoped to be able to. Bootcamp 
                just keeps me too busy. 4 more weeks and it's over. I can do anything for 4 more weeks right?<br />
                <br />
                Here's what I'm planning to do once I finish bootcamp (in somewhat particular order):
                <ul>
                    <li>Apply for at least one job a day</li>
                    <li>Go back into Java Core/Fundamentals</li>
                    <li>Relearn how to use JDBC and the Spring Framework</li>
                    <li>Build a few API projects</li>
                    <li>Recreate this website, possibly in React</li>
                </ul>
                Among several ever things like learning how to deploy apps on AWS, how to use Kubernetes, Docker, Jenkins, and other tools. There's a whole lot of Java to tackle. But for now I'm going
                to try and keep my focus on the main things here:
            </p>
            <h4>Apply for at least one job a day</h4>
            <p>Bottom line, I want a job in software development. I love coding, I love documenting, and I love the process. This is something I can see myself thriving in. In order to get a job I have
                to apply. It shouldn't matter to me where my skills are at the time, I've done this before, I can do it again. As long I keep trying to learn, I will be successful.
            </p>
            <h4>Go back into Java Core/Fundamentals</h4>
            <p>It's been over 8 weeks since I've touched Java, and though I can see the code in my head, my fundamentals are probably pretty rusty. I'll need to spend a day or two getting back up to
                speed on everything we went over in the first module. I built a rough task-list application based on that knowledge alone, but it's in a buggy state, and I want to finish it. I think
                that'd be a good personal capstone to the basics.
            </p>
            <h4>Relearn how to use JDBC and the Spring Framework</h4>
            <p>This is pretty much going to be the bread and butter for a minute. I need to refresh on how to write code that consumes an API as well as how to write my own APIs for consumption. This
                was arguably one of my favorite parts of the whole program, creating that inter-connectivity of various services. TEnmo was only the beginning.
            </p>
            <h4>Build a few API projects</h4>
            <p>Gotta put what I learned to use. I want to build a few API projects such as a Messenger API, and I had an idea for an API that when used would generate a random Trading card that could then be
                saved to a private collection. There's also a number of free public APIs that I can play around with.
            </p>
            <h4>Recreate this website, possibly in React</h4>
            <p>I have a website in mind. I'd like to make it. I could make it with bare HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript. But maybe, just maybe, I can do it in React. Maybe not. I have have no idea how that 
                will play out for me yet. React hasn't been the easiest to pick up, and I definitely have a long way to go before my grasp of JavaScript is firm.
            </p>
            <p>I'm tired, and this bootcamp has been a long road. Only a little while longer. Anyways, I hope you're having a good day.</p>

        <h3>10/18/22</h3>
        <p>Tonight was our last Professional Squad, and it was quite bittersweet. We had a lot of time to share some of our thoughts and reflections on the past 27 weeks that we've been at this. Some
            of us still feel discouraged about everything, like they don't know enough or understand enough. Resoundingly however it sounded like no one here is going to be sitting idly. This cohort is
            stocked full of many dedicated learners. For a lot of us, Merit America completely reignited our love of learning. It was certainly the push I needed to actually dedicate myself to learning
            how to code. And now there's definitely no stopping me because there's so much I want to know. There's also so much I have to relearn. I haven't worked on anything in Java for over 7 weeks
            and I'm worried about forgetting everything I learned in Module 1 and 2, which was all of the Java and Backend programming. I want to build an API, several actually. Many of my fellow 
            learners are hoping to get right into the field (myself included). But even if I don't wind up with a job right away I already have my sights set on my next objectives. I've said it many
            times since we rounded the third module, and it's that I'll be ecstatic to just have the time back. Being regularly available to my life outside of code again will be a great gift to me.<br />
            React week 3 is intense. Going over state, router, props again, arrays, forms, etc. Scrimba crammed a lot into this weeks lessons. Basically double the video length alone from the previous
            two. It's going alright, and I feel as though I'm grasping it. I managed to write at least an entire static webpage with React so I'm sure I'll grasp all of this with practice.<br />
