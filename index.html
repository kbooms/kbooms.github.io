            <p>
                I logged a few extra bugs on <a href="https://github.com/kbooms/Taskmin">Taskmin</a>. I've got some work to do that. I was able to get a Spring Boot base app up and persisting for my Item
                Shop, but other than get it standing I haven't really been able to work on it much more. I'm not committing it until I've had a chance to work on it more and clean up some of the code. 
                I've taken a few days off since graduation. A lots happened between family birthdays and it's also the holiday season. I'm trying to get back in the swing of things, as I need to be ready. I've 
                sent out about 12 applications so far, and most of it was in the past few days. I've already received one rejection, and that's fine. I only need one company to say yes and give me a chance. 
                I'm out for the moment. Hope you have a good weekend.

            <h3>12/5/22</h3>
            <p>
                HI EVERYBODY! I'M BACK! Alright let's have a recap:<br />
                So I left off just before I had started my capstone project. Now the capstone was... a lot. I focused mostly on the backend of it however. Our project was a Tinder-like Restaurant finder.
                Users would be able to search from a list of restaurants based on their area by City or Zipcode, as well as searching by cuisine type. That was my main focus for the project, building the 
                API that would search through the Database. I had a lot of struggle getting it running as I basically had to relearn the whole Server-Side API lessons from Module 2 all over again. This 
                isn't a bad thing. Just what I needed to get the job done. I built the API out in about two weeks, and it was... functional at best. My API does not want to return results when searched
                with all lowercase letters. I still haven't quite figured that part out yet. Nothing worth worrying about at this point. On December 1st, the team and I presented our MVP. The presentation
                of what we had went well, our coaches and advisors had good remarks for us.<br />
                <br />
                But enough about that. I finished Merit America and now I'm here in the Job Success Phase. The trouble with the Merit America course is there wasn't really time to apply the concepts I'd 
                learned into things that interested me. This capstone was unfortunately no different. I don't know that I will continue to work on it. I will however take what I've learned from this course, 
                and build my own programs with it. And apart from applying for jobs, THAT is what I've been doing since December 1st. Now a bit about that:</p>
                <h4>Taskmin</h4>
                <p>Taskmin is my personal ToDo application I've been writing since around the middle of Immersions 1 in Merit America. The objective is a quick and responsive list generator that can save lists
                and load them from .txt files. When I left that off I had a working list controller, and the program can save and load files. However loading a file does not clear out the previously loaded
                list. And the code is very very spaghetti flavored. From here I need to fix the file management, and do more code encapsulation. I also found something called 'JColor' that allows control of
                text and background color in terminal applications with Unicode. I'd love to implement that into this ToDo app to give it a bit more personality.<br />
                The source code for Taskmin is available here: <a href="https://github.com/kbooms/Taskmin">https://github.com/kbooms/Taskmin</a></p>
                <h4>UO Gem Calculator</h4>
                <p>Ultima Online (or UO) is a 26 year old Wizard game where you fight monsters, get loot, and increase your character's power levels. Pretty standard MMO formula. Gems are part of the loot you can
                find, there are nine different gems, each with their own individual value. I wrote a simple calculator program that asks the user to enter the quantity of all different gems they possess, and
                it will calculate the in-game gold value of said gems. Currently everything is entered manually, and the program works well enough. To flesh it out, I'd like to be able to make it interactive
                with the game itself somehow. If I can find anywhere in the game's file system where a log is generated I just might be able to pull something off where all a user has to do is click a bag of gems in
                the game and the program will calculate the value without manual input of each type.<br />

                <h4>The Item Shop</h4>
                <p>During my time at Merit America I spent a lot of time researching projects and ideas to make for portfolio projects. A lot of the different sources I found, suggested "make a store, and sell
                fake products." A lot of the approach I've seen is to list watches or other real products with ridiculously fake prices. And as I've already stated, if it doesn't interest me I probably won't like
                doing it. However, an Item Shop from an RPG? This absolute nerd can definitely work with parameters like that. So I'm building an RPG-like item shop. This started as a way for me to review Data Access
                and the DAO pattern as well as Database design. It will eventually be a full-stack project that I'll deploy, but for now I'm modeling it as a Terminal Client app similar to the TEnmo project from
                Immersions 1.<br />
                You can see the project so far here: <a href="https://github.com/kbooms/RPGStore">https://github.com/kbooms/RPGStore</a></p>
                <br />
                I guess that's about it for now. I made it through 7 months of Code Bootcamp. It was exhausting, beneficial, and fun to a fault. Now I'm just trying to find that first role, and build projects. I've
                I've also been making up for lost time with my family. Bootcamp largely kept me away from those that need me most. Also my house desperately needs my attention, and I have a long list of things to fix.
                I'm ready for a somewhat return to normal. It's definitely been nice having the personal time back. I'm gonna stop writing and get back to coding. Much to do. Wherever you are, whatever you're doing,
                I hope you're having a good day. 'Til next time folks.
            </p>

            <h3>10/25/22</h3>
            <p>
                Doing a layout update. A lot of my previous writing was cut and archived for now. When I figure out how to set up an actual blog app, I'll add it back somehow for anyone interested in 
                the nonsensical ravings of a lunatic mind. This things been up for over a month, and I haven't really had any time to actually get it as flashy as I had hoped to be able to. Bootcamp 
                just keeps me too busy. 4 more weeks and it's over. I can do anything for 4 more weeks right?<br />
                <br />
                Here's what I'm planning to do once I finish bootcamp (in somewhat particular order):
                <ul>
                    <li>Apply for at least one job a day</li>
                    <li>Go back into Java Core/Fundamentals</li>
                    <li>Relearn how to use JDBC and the Spring Framework</li>
                    <li>Build a few API projects</li>
                    <li>Recreate this website, possibly in React</li>
                </ul>
                Among several ever things like learning how to deploy apps on AWS, how to use Kubernetes, Docker, Jenkins, and other tools. There's a whole lot of Java to tackle. But for now I'm going
                to try and keep my focus on the main things here:
            </p>
            <h4>Apply for at least one job a day</h4>
            <p>Bottom line, I want a job in software development. I love coding, I love documenting, and I love the process. This is something I can see myself thriving in. In order to get a job I have
                to apply. It shouldn't matter to me where my skills are at the time, I've done this before, I can do it again. As long I keep trying to learn, I will be successful.
            </p>
            <h4>Go back into Java Core/Fundamentals</h4>
            <p>It's been over 8 weeks since I've touched Java, and though I can see the code in my head, my fundamentals are probably pretty rusty. I'll need to spend a day or two getting back up to
                speed on everything we went over in the first module. I built a rough task-list application based on that knowledge alone, but it's in a buggy state, and I want to finish it. I think
                that'd be a good personal capstone to the basics.
            </p>
            <h4>Relearn how to use JDBC and the Spring Framework</h4>
            <p>This is pretty much going to be the bread and butter for a minute. I need to refresh on how to write code that consumes an API as well as how to write my own APIs for consumption. This
                was arguably one of my favorite parts of the whole program, creating that inter-connectivity of various services. TEnmo was only the beginning.
            </p>
            <h4>Build a few API projects</h4>
            <p>Gotta put what I learned to use. I want to build a few API projects such as a Messenger API, and I had an idea for an API that when used would generate a random Trading card that could then be
                saved to a private collection. There's also a number of free public APIs that I can play around with.
            </p>
            <h4>Recreate this website, possibly in React</h4>
            <p>I have a website in mind. I'd like to make it. I could make it with bare HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript. But maybe, just maybe, I can do it in React. Maybe not. I have have no idea how that 
                will play out for me yet. React hasn't been the easiest to pick up, and I definitely have a long way to go before my grasp of JavaScript is firm.
            </p>
            <p>I'm tired, and this bootcamp has been a long road. Only a little while longer. Anyways, I hope you're having a good day.</p>

        <h3>10/18/22</h3>
        <p>Tonight was our last Professional Squad, and it was quite bittersweet. We had a lot of time to share some of our thoughts and reflections on the past 27 weeks that we've been at this. Some
            of us still feel discouraged about everything, like they don't know enough or understand enough. Resoundingly however it sounded like no one here is going to be sitting idly. This cohort is
            stocked full of many dedicated learners. For a lot of us, Merit America completely reignited our love of learning. It was certainly the push I needed to actually dedicate myself to learning
            how to code. And now there's definitely no stopping me because there's so much I want to know. There's also so much I have to relearn. I haven't worked on anything in Java for over 7 weeks
            and I'm worried about forgetting everything I learned in Module 1 and 2, which was all of the Java and Backend programming. I want to build an API, several actually. Many of my fellow 
            learners are hoping to get right into the field (myself included). But even if I don't wind up with a job right away I already have my sights set on my next objectives. I've said it many
            times since we rounded the third module, and it's that I'll be ecstatic to just have the time back. Being regularly available to my life outside of code again will be a great gift to me.<br />
            React week 3 is intense. Going over state, router, props again, arrays, forms, etc. Scrimba crammed a lot into this weeks lessons. Basically double the video length alone from the previous
            two. It's going alright, and I feel as though I'm grasping it. I managed to write at least an entire static webpage with React so I'm sure I'll grasp all of this with practice.<br />
