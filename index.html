        <h4>9/15/22</h4>
        <p>I closed up shop for the night. Got my grid fixed, messed up what I tried to start as the dev-log. Oh well. Live and learn I guess.
        Had hoped to do a bit more on it tonight, but I forgot my laptop charger at home, and I have jobs to apply to first. Wish me luck.</p>

        <h4>9/20/22</h4>
        <p>I just screwed the whole thing up. And at this point I have no idea where I went wrong, but I might have messed up a git merge. None of
            my CSS looks right, and I might have to start over. God damnit.</p>
